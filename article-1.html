                        One of our most common requests is, "How do I put my camera on my website?".  It has always been possible, but the aim of this example page is to make it more accessable to everyone.  Along the way we will explain several other aspects of our API.  The most important of which is our real-time event stream (refered to as our poll stream).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Eagle Eye provides two video streams for each camera.  The first is the full resolution, unmodified stream from the camera.  The other is what we call the preview stream.  It is a lower resolution version of the full video stream.  We provide the preview stream as a series of JPEG images.  Typically the preview stream is updated once per second but it can be as fast as 4 frames per second.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All requests to our API should include an API key that you have created.  This key unique identifies the developer in our system.  This is helpful in troubleshooting problems and tuning throttling and bandwidth limits for known Technology Partners.  In the future we will require that the API key for all requests and including it now will prevent it breaking in the future.

                       The first step in working with our API is to login with your username, password.  After the Authentication step, you will get a token which you will then need to pass into the Authorization step.  We automatically return you the user information for the user who just logged-in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After successfully completing the login process you will get a session cookie for use on all calls during the remainder of your session (session cookie experation length is an account setting).

                        You subscribe to the poll stream by passing the device_id and the resources that you are interesting in receiving.  Depending on use cases you may just need to know when there is a new preview image available.  You can the ability to monitor everything about each device such as status, motion events, recording events, analytics, setting changes, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After you subscribe to the poll stream you will get back the lasted state for the resources that have been requested.  You can use this as a starting point to start displaying this information.  You will be notified of all changes going forward.  Subscribing also returns another cookie that is passed in addition to the authorization cookie.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If your connection is interrupted or your polling session cookie expires, you can always re-subscribe to get the latest values and be back in sync.

                    <p>
                        You should immediately check the poll stream for new events.  The poll stream will return the latest values each time you check. Depending on your application you can check the poll stream as often as needed.  The response is based on the poll session cookie so there is no advantage in making simultanious connections to it.  Immediately opening a new connection each time you get a response is the recommending process.  This also allows your interface to adapt to changing bandwidth conditions.

                        As events come in on the poll stream you can decide what to do with them.  For example, we track which cameras on the screen and don't process those events to update the preview stream until those cameras are back in view.  For things like status or analytic events, you may want to continue processing that data on every update to keep your data in sync.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some events will last longer than a single iteration through this loop.  We refer to these as span events and at the end of a span event we provide the start and end times together so that you have the canonical timestamps for the event.

                        Inside the last step is usually where our Technology Partners work their unique brands of magic.  Some customers will use facial recognition to aid access control systems or assist retial loss prevention teams.  Others will use the analytics events to adjust the predicted staffing needs in the future.
